It wasn't quite the dawn of historical computing, but it was early in the years of the personal computer
and like today's 20-something children, I thought it was all new, exciting, and
unique. Geniuses strode the earth, and I didn't give a whole lot of thought into
what had come before. What was going on in the here and now is what mattered.

What we had before, before the Apple II, before the Commodore 64, before the
[VIC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20), 
before the primative hardware Bill Gates was working with in Albuquerque, were
giant dinosaur machines with remote terminals or card readers. These were the
computers of 1970s popular imagination. They had to take up
space and be magaged and maintained by magicians in some cable-strewn
room where you dare not touch anything.

Roger ran the PDP-11 at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab up in the hills over the
UC campus and I had volunteered, or rather, had *been* volunteered to write
a FORTRAN program (*program*, not *app*) that used a dot-matrix printer to 
generate grey-scale star map images, printed out by manipulating the printer
roller to slide forward, back, a fractional line up and down, using various
key characters and overlaps to go from an entirely white rectangle to a dense,
completely black one and everything in between. The Supernova Search group didn't
have budget for a graphics printer. They had a dot-matrix (not cheap at the time,
either), and they had cheap labor in a sophomore undergrad physics student who
had volunteered.

Winding even further back, it was 
[Professor Frank Crawford](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/frankscrawford.htm)
who volunteered me
into the position. I wandered into his office hours one day in 1981 while taking his
first year physics course and asked him a question
about using fiber optics to establish a visible light based interferometer with
collection points on opposite sides of the earth. I think that impressed him
as something a budding physics prodigy might ask, so he in turn asked me if I'd
like to work with his group up at the 
"[RadLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory)."

I said yes, drove up the hill to start thinking I'd be playing with cool stuff
like telescopes or liquid nitrogen-cooled 
[charge-coupled devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device),
but instead I was introduced to Roger and plunked down in front of a terminal.
Not immediately thereafter as I remember, but soon, I heard Roger's voice
cursing me from the computer room when I logged in when I shouldn't have. The
operation of the PDP-11 beast was beyond my knowledge, and after Roger's anger
I grew to think I could break it with a wrong keystroke.

To that point, my programming experience was limited to a Computer Math course
I took in high school in 1978, a lot of self-taught BASIC, and a trimester of Intro 
to Computer Ccience at UC Berekeley where we fed in (actually, handed over to the
technician) stacks of FORTRAN typed 
[punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card).

The star map program was my first completed and delivered piece of code that
someone else relied on. I didn't think at the time I'd have a career in software
development. And it's not until I've actually typed these words that I realize
it was my first deliverable, and the beginning of my career.
